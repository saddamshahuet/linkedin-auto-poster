# BrowserMCP LinkedIn Automation Steps

This document captures the exact steps used by BrowserMCP to automate LinkedIn posting, which were then converted to reusable automation code.

## Successful BrowserMCP Steps Executed

### 1. Navigation and Setup
```javascript
// Navigate to LinkedIn
await browser.navigate("https://www.linkedin.com");

// Take screenshot to analyze page structure
await browser.screenshot();

// Capture page snapshot for interactive elements

## Conversion to Playwright Code

The BrowserMCP steps were successfully converted to Playwright automation code in:
- `src/automation/linkedin-browser.js` - Main browser automation
- `src/content/ai-generator.js` - AI content generation
- `src/index.js` - Orchestration logic

This allows the same functionality to be run programmatically without manual BrowserMCP interaction.
